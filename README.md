Recreation of Unreal's Spring Arm Component in Unity.

Spring Arm Component is a solution for cameras to expand/retract based on gameplay situations. Typically when you add a Camera to a character for the purposes of creating a third person perspective. Spring Arm automatically controls how the camera handles situations where it becomes obstructed by level geometry or other objects in the level.


## Features

- Multiple collision detection using Raycasts
- Collision test resolution for different levels of preciseness
- TPS camera movement integrated
- Takes a minute to setup
- Fully commented code for better understanding


## Getting Started

Set the “Tool Handle Position” to Pivot mode for this to work correctly.

Just drag and drop the SpringArm prefab from Prefabs folder to Hierarchy and delete your existing Main Camera or alternatively create a new GameObject, add SpringArm Script to it and make your Main Camera the child of this gameobject.

## Usage

- Target : The gameobject (Transform) which SpringArm has to follow.

- Movement Smooth Time : The camera lag time while following the target.

- Target Arm Length : Maximum distance to which the camera can move to behind the target. (Red line)

- Socket Offset : Offset for the camera from the SpringArm (Socket is the position where camera will be).

- Target Offset : Offset of the SpringArm from the target.

- Do Collision Test : Turn On or Off collision tests.

- Collision Test Resolution : The count of rays raycasting from the SpringArm position to Camera position also referred as probe.

Resolution - 4

Resolution - 20

- Collision Probe Size : Radius of collision (Green sphere).

- Collision Smooth Time : The camera lag time while moving for collision tests.

- Collision Layer Mask : The layer mask for collision tests.

- Use Control Rotation : To turn on/off the mouse input for rotation of the spring arm.
